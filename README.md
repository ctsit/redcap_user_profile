# REDCap User Profile
REDCap User Profile is an external module that extends user accounts information according to your needs - e.g. address, country of birth, job position, etc. This module provides:

- An easy way to manage user profiles
- An API to assist developers in accessing user profiles information

## How does it work?
This module uses a REDCap project to manage and store additional user attributes as data entry records.

## Prerequisites
- REDCap >= 8.0.3

## Installation
- Clone this repo into to `<redcap-root>/modules/redcap_user_profile_v<version_number>`.
- Go to **Control Center > External Modules** and enable User Profile - it will be enabled for all projects by default.

## Configuration

### Making sure authentication is enabled
If you are working in a test instance, you must turn on some form of authentication as this module builds upon account management features. Table-based authentication will work fine.

### Create a User Profile project
Create a REDCap project in order to extend user information according to your needs - e.g. address, country of birth, job position, etc. **Make sure to create a field that represents REDCap username** - that's how user accounts and profiles are connected.  A sample user profile project is available in [samples folder](samples/UserProfile.xml)

### Filling the settings form
Go to **Control Center > External Modules**, click on User Profile's **Configure** button, and fill the form as follows:
  - **Project**: The project you created
  - **Username field**: The key of username field you created

## Managing User Profiles
You can manage user profiles in two ways.

### Option 1
Directly on User Profile project - creating new records, making sure to associate a REDCap username for each profile.

### Option 2
By accessing user account page (go to **Control Manager > Browse Users** and click on **View Users** to choose the account).

There, you will be able to see a **Create User Profile** button or an **Edit User Profile** button. Either button will redirect you to the user profile form - for new profiles, the username field will be automatically prefilled.

## API usage
User Profile module provides `UserProfile` class. Here is an example of usage:

```php
<?php

use UserProfile\UserProfile;

$profile = new UserProfile('test_username');
$data = $profile->getProfileData();

// Assuming your User Profile project contains an address field which key is 'street_address'.
$address = $data['street_address'];
```

Here are other methods that might be useful:

```php
<?php

// Gets profile record ID.
$profile->getProfileId();

// Gets username.
$profile->getUsername();

// Gets username field key.
$profile->getUsernameField();

// Gets user profile project ID.
$profile->getProjectId();
```

There is also a static method to get all available profiles.

```php
<?php

use UserProfile\UserProfile;

$profiles = UserProfiles::getProfiles();

// Creating an array of addresses, keyed by username.
$addresses = array();
foreach ($profiles as $username => $profile) {
    $data = $profile->getProfileData();
    $addresses[$username] = $data['street_address'];
}
```
